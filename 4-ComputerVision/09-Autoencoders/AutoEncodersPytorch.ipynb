In the case of image classification, we need to separate images into different classes, which is a manual effort.\n","\n","However, we might want to use raw (unlabeled) data for training CNN feature extractors, which is called **self-supervised learning**. Instead of labels, we will use training images as both network input and output. The main idea of **autoencoder** is that we will have an **encoder network** that converts input image into some **latent space** (normally it is just a vector of some smaller size), the then **decoder network**, whose goal would be to reconstruct the original image.\n","\n","Since we are training autoencoder to capture as much of the information from the original image as possible for accurate reconstruction, the network tries to find the best **embedding** of input images to capture the meaning.\n","\n","![AutoEncoder Diagram](images/autoencoder_schema.jpg)\n","\n","Let's create
