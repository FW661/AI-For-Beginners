# Classification with PyTorch/TensorFlow

Lab Assignment from [AI for Beginners Curriculum](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-for-beginners).

## Task

Solve two classification problems using single- and multi-layered fully-connected networks using PyTorch or TensorFlow:

1. Iris classification problem
1. MNIST handwritten digit classification problem

Try different network architectures to achieve the best accuracy you can get.


## Stating Notebook

Start the lab by opening [MyFW_MNIST.ipynb](MyFW_MNIST.ipynb)

## Questions

As a result of this lab, try to answer the following questions:

- Does the inter-layer activation function affect network performance?
- Do we need 2- or 3-layered network for this task?
- Did you experience any problems training the network? Especially as the number of layers increased.
- How do weights of the network behave during training? You may plot max abs value of weights vs. epoch to understand the relation.
