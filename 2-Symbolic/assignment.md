# Build an Ontology

Building a knowledge base is all about categorizing a model representing facts about a topic. Pick a topic - like a person, a place, or a thing - and then build a model of that topic. Use some of the techniques and model-building strategies described in this lesson. An example would be creating an ontology of a living room with furniture, lights, and so on. How does the living room differ from the kitchen? The bathroom? How do you know it's a living room and not a dining room? Use [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) to build your ontology.

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| A Protégé link is shared with a multilevel ontology of a rich topic        |  The ontology is simpler than usual     |  The project is too simple or has bugs     |   The link is not shared         |
